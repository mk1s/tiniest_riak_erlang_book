## Who is this for?

This "book" is targeted to Database Administrators, DevOps, and Developers looking to gain a better understanding of interacting with the Erlang Runtime System and its relationship to Riak.

## Assumptions

No prior knowledge of Erlang is assumed, and this writing is by no means a thorough discussion of Erlang or the Erlang Runtime System.  The intent is to provide some basic concepts that will allow you to explore Riak, Erlang and the Erlang Runtime System.  

For more information on Erlang here are some additional resources:

* [Official Erlang Documentation](http://www.erlang.org/doc.html)

* [Learn You Some Erlang](http://learnyousomeerlang.com)

A basic knowledge of Riak is helpful, but I will attempt to provide enough information when necessary.  

For more in depth info on Riak's Architecture and Features consult

* [The Little Riak Book](http://littleriakbook.com)
* [Official Basho Documenation](http://docs.basho.com/)
