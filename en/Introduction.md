# The Tiniest Riak (Erlang) Book

## Introduction

Riak is predominately developed using Erlang, a powerful functional programming language that enables one to develop highly available and concurrent systems.

While Riak comes with many command line tools for cluster administration, health, and status, there are times when we need to interact with the system more directly.

In the oncoming chapters we will look at the relationship between Erlang and Riak and introduce some useful concepts and examples to hopefully expand your toolkit.
